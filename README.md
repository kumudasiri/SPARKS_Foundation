#Task_6 #Decision Trees
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
The Iris data set consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa-0, Iris virginica-1 and Iris versicolor-2). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
